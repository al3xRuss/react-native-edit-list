# react-native-edit-list

This is a simple react-native application which edits a list. It's not styled, but I may come back and style it at some point for kicks when I don't have so many tasks in the air.  

## Getting Started

To get started, first install all the necessary dependencies.
```
> npm install
```

Run it with npm
```
> npm start
```

This does require the [Expo Client](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) to be installed on your mobile device, as I haven't completed extending the Modal. You can find this at [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) for iOS, and [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US) for Android.

After installing the Expo Client on your mobile device, the easiest way to view this application is by scanning the QR code, which will be provided after running npm start
